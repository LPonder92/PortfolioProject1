<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I’m Lisa, and I’m at the beginning of my journey into web development. I come from an operations background, and I’ve always enjoyed learning new skills and finding creative ways to solve problems./<p>

<p>Recently, I started exploring web development and found that building websites is both challenging and really rewarding. I’m learning step by step and looking forward to diving into CSS and JavaScript next.</p>
  
<p>This portfolio is a reflection of what I’ve learned so far and a space to share my progress as I grow. My goal is to eventually build user-friendly, accessible sites—and maybe even turn this into a whole new career. Thanks for visiting!</p>
